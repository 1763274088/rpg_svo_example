# rpg_svo_example
This is the example code to use the SVO binary installation. **If you have any problem regarding using SVO binaries,
you can either start an issue or contact Zichao Zhang (zzhang AT ifi DOT uzh DOT ch).**

To use `SVO` as a binary form, you need to request the binaries of `SVO` from [here](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/svo2.html).
The binaries you get already include a copy of this repository, therefore they are self-contained.

This repository will be used for the following purposes:
* Keep track of the update of the binaries
* Add new launch files and example code to use the binaries

If the binaries are updated, you can download the new version from the original links in the email you received.
